# Rules

## Set 1

```txt
**1.** Use common sense and be civil.
**2.** Don't harass other members or staff.
**3.** Don't advertise, especially in direct messages.
**4.** Don't post NSFW, illegal, or otherwise disturbing or inappropriate material.
**5.** Don't randomly ping or disturb members or staff.
**6.** Don't incite drama.
**7.** Refrain from using languages aside from English.
**8.** Always follow Discord's rules. They can be found at <https://dis.gd/guidelines> and <https://dis.gd/terms>.

These rules are not a comprehensive guide of what will be moderated, and staff will regulate content which they believe to violate the spirit of the rules at their own discretion.
```

### Rationale

Refrain from using languages aside from English. - English is the only language that a large enough portion of staff speak and can effectively moderate in, and as such is the only language that we allow.

## Extras

### Unfair Punishment

```txt
If you believe you have been punished unfairly please DM @Modmail with an explanation of what you believe to be the issue so that we can resolve it.
